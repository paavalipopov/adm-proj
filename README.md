Comparison of pairwise statistics for connectivity estimation

# project outline 
Find statistically important group differences in Pearson-estimated connectivity
- Write a general setup for the experiments
- Find important features using stattests 
- Train classifiers, inspect the features that they found important
  
Add other techniques for signal comparisons
- Run the same analysis on this new data, compare results
- Find features that are consistently important
  
Validate
- Rerun the analysis on subsets of my data, see if results survive permutation tests
- Try more classifiers/stattests
